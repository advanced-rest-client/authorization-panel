  /**
   * Authorization panel used in the request panel to get user authorization information.
   *
   * It is a set of forms that allow set up the authorization method for a HTTP request.
   *
   * The element do not perform authorization. Depending on selected method there
   * are different ways of dealing with the authorization.
   *
   * ## Auth methods availability
   *
   * By default the element renders all authorization methods available to it.
   *
   * Currently these are:
   * - none (auth is optional)
   * - basic
   * - digest
   * - ntlm
   * - OAuth 2.0
   * - OAuth 1.0
   *
   * The list can be changed by setting the `securedBy` property to the
   * [AMF](https://github.com/mulesoft/amf) security description.
   *
   * Alternatively, use `iron-meta` element with `key` property set to `auth-methods`
   * and `value` property set to list of suppored methods.
   *
   * #### Example
   *
   * ```html
   * <iron-meta key="auth-methods" value='[null, "basic", "oauth1", "oauth2"]'></iron-meta>
   * ```
   *
   * Keys can be any of `none`, `basic`, `ntlm`, `digest`, `oauth1` and `oauth2`.
   *
   * Note, that if you set meta data and `securedBy` property it will use combination
   * of both. The base list of rendered methods is meta data list and then reduced to
   * defined in RAML methods. Also note, that custom auth methods are always rendered.
   *
   * ## Supported methods
   *
   * Detailed information about authorization methods can be find in the
   * [auth-methods documentation page]
   * (https://elements.advancedrestclient.com/elements/auth-methods).
   *
   * ### Basic Authentication
   *
   * The element sends the `request-header-changed` custom event to inform any other
   * element that is listening to this event that header value has changed
   * (Authorization in this case). The `raml-headers-form` is an example of an
   * element that is listening for this event and change request headers value
   * when auth data change.
   *
   * ### OAuth 2.0
   *
   * The [Oauth 2 form]
   * (https://elements.advancedrestclient.com/elements/auth-methods?active=auth-method-oauth2)
   * sends the `oauth2-token-requested` custom event with the OAuth settings provided
   * by the user.
   * Any element / hosting app can handle this event and perform authorization.
   * ARC elements provides the
   * [oauth2-authorization](https://elements.advancedrestclient.com/elements/oauth-authorization)
   * element (from the `oauth-authorization` package) that can be placed anywhere
   * in the DOM (from current element where `authorization-panel` is attached up
   * to the body) and perform OAuth athorization.
   *
   * However it can be also done by any other element / app  or even server.
   * See `<oauth2-authorization>` for detailed documentation.
   *
   *
   * Note: OAuth 2.0 server flow probably will not work in regular browser
   * environment because main providers aren't setting CORS headers. Therefore the
   * request will be canceled by the browser.
   *
   * To make it work, handle the `oauth2-token-requested` fired from the inside of this element.
   * If it's browser flow type (implicit) then the `oauth2-authorization` element can be used.
   * For other other types, handle and cancel the event and use server to handle token exchange.
   * The ARC elements offers a
   * [Chrome extension](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/api-console-extension)
   * that once installed will propxy auth requests and made the exchange even for
   * the server flow. The application should use
   * [api-console-ext-comm](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/api-console-ext-comm)
   * element to communicate with the extension.
   *
   * #### `redirect-url` property for OAuth 2.0
   *
   * OAuth protocol requires to define a redirect URL that is registered in the
   * OAuth provider. The redirect URL should point to a page that will pass the URL
   * parameters to the opener page (OAuth 2 panel).
   * If you application uses the
   * [oauth-authorization](https://elements.advancedrestclient.com/elements/oauth-authorization)
   * element then it provides a popup that pases the data back to the application.
   * In this case your redirect URL would be
   * `https://your.domain.com/bower_components/oauth-authorization/oauth-popup.html`.
   * User have to change OAuth provider's settings and adjust the redirect URL to
   * point to this page.
   *
   * You can also use the
   * [oauth-popup.html]
   * (https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/oauth-authorization/blob/stage/oauth-popup.html)
   * to build your own page.
   *
   * ### OAuth 1.0a
   *
   * Oauth 1a is not currently supported. However, it uses obsolite hashing
   * algorithms and should not be used.
   *
   * ### Digest Authentication
   *
   * When the user provide all required information for Digest authorization then
   * this element will fire `request-header-changed` custom event which will do the
   * same thing as in case of Basic authentication.
   *
   * ### Example
   *
   * ```
   * <authorization-panel
   *  redirect-url="http://domain.com/bower_components/oauth-authorization/oauth-popup.html"
   *  ></authorization-panel>
   * ```
   *
   * ### Styling
   *
   * `<authorization-panel>` provides the following custom properties and mixins for styling:
   *
   * Custom property | Description | Default
   * ----------------|-------------|----------
   * `--authorization-panel` | Mixin applied to the element | `{}`
   * `--arc-font-body1` | Theme mixin, Mixin applied to the elements that are containg text | `{}`
   * `--empty-info` | Mixin applied to the element that renders no methods availability message | `{}`
   *
   * Also check [auth-methods documentation page]
   * (https://elements.advancedrestclient.com/elements/auth-methods)
   * for methods styling instructions.
   *
   * ## Changes in version 2
   *
   * - Renamed properties:
   *  - `redirectUrl` -> `redirectUri`
   *  - `_restoreSettings()` is not `restore()` function
   * - `auth-settings-changed` custom event is stopped from bubbling. Listen for
   * `authorization-settings-changed` event instead.
